# 🧰 Installing Node.js (Step 1)

Before we can use TypeScript, we need to install **Node.js** — it gives us access to the TypeScript compiler and other tools.

---

## 🧠 Why Node.js?

Think of Node.js as the engine that runs JavaScript outside the browser. It also gives us `npm` (Node Package Manager), which we’ll use to install TypeScript.

## 🪜 Step-by-Step Installation

### 🖥️ 1. Go to the official Node.js website:

👉 [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

### 🧩 2. Choose the **LTS (Long-Term Support)** version

It’s more stable and beginner-friendly.

### 💾 3. Download and install

- Follow the installer instructions
- Accept default settings
- Restart your terminal or computer if needed

---

## ✅ Verify Installation

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
node -v
```
