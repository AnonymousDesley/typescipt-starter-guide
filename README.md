## 💡 Why TypeScript?

TypeScript is like JavaScript with a safety net. It helps you catch mistakes early, write cleaner code, and build scalable projects. Once you get the hang of it, you’ll wonder how you ever coded without it.

## 🧠 Learning Mindset

You might feel stuck sometimes — that’s normal.  
Just take it one file at a time. Ask questions. Break things. Fix them. That’s how real devs learn.

> “Confusion is the first sign of learning. Keep going — you’re doing great.”
