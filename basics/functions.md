# 🧠 Functions in TypeScript

Functions are like mini-machines — you give them input, they do something, and give you output.

In TypeScript, we make these machines smarter by telling them what kind of input and output to expect.

## 🔧 Basic Syntax

```ts
function greet(name: string): string {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}
```
